            <h2 id="Traditional-Word-Vectors"><a href="#Traditional-Word-Vectors" class="headerlink" title="Traditional Word Vectors"></a>Traditional Word Vectors</h2><p>Before diving directly into Word2Vec it’s worth while to do a brief overview of some of the traditional methods that pre-date neural embeddings.</p>
<p>这个是用来描述文章的，有一个大的dict，然后一片文章是如何进行表示、<br><strong>Bag of Words</strong> or BoW vector representations are the most common used traditional vector representation. Each word or n-gram is linked to a vector index and marked as 0 or 1 depending on whether it occurs in a given document.</p>
<p>An example of a one hot bag of words representation for documents with one word.</p>
<p><img src="http://ww1.sinaimg.cn/large/e9a223b5ly1g3a0alr102j20l104jt9t.jpg" alt=""><br>优缺点（重点是缺点）: 一方面只是一种counter，没有考虑语义信息；另一方面有些 words 是明显的 relevant than others.<br>BoW representations are often used in methods of document classification where the frequency of each word, bi-word or tri-word is a useful feature for training classifiers. One challenge with bag of word representations is that they don’t encode any information with regards to the meaning of a given word.<br>In BoW word occurrences are evenly weighted independently of how frequently or what context they occur. However in most NLP tasks some words are more relevant than others.</p>
<p>这个是可以认识是对于 bag of words “relevant” 上的改进：使得 选择的words 更加的 “representative” 文章的调性。<br>TF-IDF, short for term frequency–inverse document frequency, is a numerical statistic that is intended to reflect how important a word or n-gram is to a document in a collection or corpus. They provide some weighting to a given word based on the context it occurs.The tf–idf value increases proportionally to the number of times a word appears in a document and is offset by the number of documents in the corpus that contain the word, which helps to adjust for the fact that some words appear more frequently than others.</p>
<p>但是对于 bag of words 中“没有体现语义” 的缺陷还是没有 deal with。<br>However even though tf-idf BoW representations provide weights to different words they are unable to capture the word meaning.</p>
<p>这个名字只是因为有定义而存在的名字<br><strong>Distributional Embeddings</strong> enable word vectors to encapsulate contextual context. Each embedding vector is represented based on the mutual information it has with other words in a given corpus.<br>重点就是这种方式是要 predict a target word from context words，一定是要能够体现语境的。<br><strong>Predictive models</strong> learn their vectors in order to improve their predictive ability of a loss such as the loss of predicting the vector for a target word from the vectors of the surrounding context words.<br>word2vec 是一种思想，有两种CBOW 和skip-gram 两种实现。<br><strong>Word2Vec</strong> is a predictive embedding model. There are two main Word2Vec architectures that are used to produce a distributed representation of words:</p>
<p>CBOW没有体现 context words 的order，但是训练速度快。<br>Continuous bag-of-words (CBOW) — The order of context words does not influence prediction (bag-of-words assumption).</p>
<p>skip-gram  weights nearbt context words heavily 效果相对于 cbow 更加， 但训练速度相对比较慢。<br>Continuous skip-gram weighs nearby context words more heavily than more distant context words. While order still is not captured each of the context vectors are weighed and compared independently vs CBOW which weighs against the average context.</p>
<p>CBOW is faster while skip-gram is slower but does a better job for infrequent words.</p>
<p><strong>glove</strong> （g lou v）<br>这个不属于 word2vec，其只是考虑了 local context，没有考虑 global context<br>Both CBOW and Skip-Grams are “predictive” models, in that they only take local contexts into account.  word2vec does not take advantage of global context.<br>(细节 能看懂就看)<br> GloVe embeddings by contrast leverage the same intuition behind the co-occurrence matrix (共生矩阵) used distributional embeddings, but uses neural methods to decompose the co-occurrence matrix into more expressive and dense word vectors.<br>效果，和word2vec 相比没有  definitively better results<br>While GloVe vectors are faster to train, neither GloVe or Word2Vec has been shown to provide definitively better results rather they should both be evaluated for a given dataset.</p>
<p><strong>fasttext</strong><br>这个主要是 each word + n-gram within each word， 最后的效果是好于 word2vec 的。<br>FastText, builds on Word2Vec by learning vector representations for each word and the n-grams found within each word. The values of the representations are then averaged into one vector at each training step. While this adds a lot of additional computation to training it enables word embeddings to encode sub-word information. FastText vectors have been shown to be more accurate than Word2Vec vectors by a number of different measures</p>

<p>RNNs (LSTM/GRU)</p>
<p>encoder- decoder 结构</p>
<p>attention and copy mechanisms<br>这个是 attention 机制提出的背景：解决 句子中的长依赖。<br>While in theory they can capture long term dependencies they tend to struggle modeling longer sequences, this is still an open problem.</p>
<p>One cause for sub-optimal performance standard RNN encoder-decoder models for sequence to sequence tasks such as NER or translation is that they weight the impact each input vector evenly on each output vector when in reality specific words in the input sequence may carry more importance at different time steps.<br>Attention mechanisms provide a means of weighting the contextual impact of each input vector on each output prediction of the RNN. These mechanisms are responsible for much of the current or near current state of the art in Natural language processing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>attention</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In sum, algorithms can allocate attention, and they can learn how to do so, by adjusting the weights they assign to various inputs. Imagine a heat map over a photo. The heat is attention.<br>One of the limits of traditional word vectors is that they presume that a word’s meaning is relatively stable across sentences.<br>并不是物理上的二维关系能够表示词语之间的 relationship，有时候是需要高纬空间进行表示的。<br>In fact, the strongest relationships binding a given word to the rest of the sentence may be with words quite distant from it.<br>从 credit assignment的角度阐述了 neural networks 就是 allocating importance to input featueres。<br>The fundamental task of all neural networks is credit assignment. Credit assignment is allocating importance to input features through the weights of the neural network’s model. Learning is the process by which neural networks figure out which input features correlate highly with the outcomes the net tries to predict, and their learnings are embodied in the adjusted quantities of the weights that result in accurate decisions about the data they’re exposed to.<br>这个是传统的 LSTM （encoder -decoder） 模型，问题在于当句子过长（比如说大于20 words）之后，encoder 是无法 memory 之前的所有 words，所以效果就会变得差一些。</p>
<p><img src="http://ww1.sinaimg.cn/large/e9a223b5ly1g3a478w59aj21hc0ixmzq.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>但是 attention 就是模仿了人翻译过程，一段作为一个单位，然后进行翻译。这样就可以持续保证较高中确率的输出。<br>In neural networks, attention primarily serves as a memory-access mechanism.<br><img src="http://ww1.sinaimg.cn/large/e9a223b5ly1g3a47iu166j20ck072t90.jpg" alt=""><br>  就是每次的输出都是关注不同的地方，但是至于哪里更加重要，这个交给了 feedback mechanism 反向传播。<br>Above, a model highlights which pixels it is focusing on as it predicts the underlined word in the respective captions. Below, a language model highlights the words from one language, French, that were relevant as it produced the English words in the translation. As you can see, attention provides us with a route to interpretability. We can render attention as a heat map over input data such as words and pixels, and thus communicate to human operators how a neural network made a decision. (This could be the basis of a feedback mechanism whereby those humans tell the network to pay attention to certain features and not others.)<br> (This could be the basis of a feedback mechanism whereby those humans tell the network to pay attention to certain features and not others.)<br> <img src="http://ww1.sinaimg.cn/large/e9a223b5ly1g3a487h7rej2078079mx1.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Additionally in Machine Reading Comprehension and Summarization systems RNNs often tend to generate results, that while on first glance look structurally correct are in reality hallucinated or incorrect. One mechanism that helps mitigate some of these issues is the Copy Mechanism.<br>同上面那个是一样的<br>The copy mechanism is an additional layer applied during decoding that decides whether it is better to generate the next word from the source sentence or from the general embedding vocabulary.</p>

<p>Taming Recurrent Neural Networks for Better Summarization<br>Two types of summarization：Extractive （You might think of these approaches as like a highlighter.） Abstractive（By the same analogy, these approaches are like a pen.）<br>The great majority of existing approaches to automatic summarization are extractive – mostly because it is much easier to select text than it is to generate text from scratch.<br>但是一个问题在于，只是使用 extrative way 可能得到相同的words，<br>Problem 1: The summaries sometimes reproduce factual details inaccurately (e.g. Germany beat Argentina 3-2). This is especially common for rare or out-of-vocabulary words such as 2-0.<br>Problem 2: The summaries sometimes repeat themselves (e.g. Germany beat Germany beat Germany beat…)<br>Easier Copying with Pointer-Generator Networks。这个跟 attention 不是很相关，简单说就是In this way, the pointer-generator network is a best of both worlds, combining both extraction (pointing) and abstraction (generating).</p>
<p>To tackle Problem 2 (repetitive summaries), we use a technique called coverage. The idea is that we use the attention distribution to keep track of what’s been covered so far, and penalize the network for attending to same parts again.</p>
<p>elmo (e l  mo)<br>elmo 产生一个 embedding 是根据 context 产生的。<br>ELMo is a model generates embeddings for a word based on the context it appears thus generating slightly different embeddings for each of its occurrence.<br>（感觉理解一个概念都是 根据其 for example 进行理解的）<br>For example, the word “play” in the sentence above using standard word embeddings encodes multiple meanings such as the verb to play or in the case of the sentence a theatre production. In standard word embeddings such as Glove, Fast Text or Word2Vec each instance of the word play would have the same representation.</p>

            <p>Following are four common methods of hyperparameter optimization for machine learning in order of increasing efficiency:</p>
<ul>
<li>Manual</li>
<li>Grid search</li>
<li>Random search</li>
<li>Bayesian model-based optimization</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Random-Search"><a href="#Random-Search" class="headerlink" title="Random Search"></a>Random Search</h2><p>First we will implement a common technique for hyperparameter optimization: random search. Each iteration, we choose a random set of model hyperparameters from a search space. Empirically, random search is very effective, returning nearly as good results as grid search with a significant reduction in time spent searching. However, it is still an uninformed method in the sense that it does not use past evaluations of the objective function to inform the choices it makes for the next evaluation.</p>
<p>Random search uses the following four parts, which also are used in Bayesian hyperparameter optimization:</p>
<ul>
<li>Domain: values over which to search</li>
<li>Optimization algorithm: pick the next values at random! (yes this qualifies as an algorithm)</li>
<li>Objective function to minimize: in this case our metric is cross validation ROC AUC</li>
<li>Results history that tracks the hyperparameters tried and the cross validation metric</li>
</ul>
<p>Random search can be implemented in the Scikit-Learn library using RandomizedSearchCV, however, because we are using Early Stopping (to determine the optimal number of estimators), we will have to implement the method ourselves (more practice!). This is pretty straightforward, and many of the ideas in random search will transfer over to Bayesian hyperparameter optimization.</p>

<h2 id="Bayesian-Hyperparameter-Optimization"><a href="#Bayesian-Hyperparameter-Optimization" class="headerlink" title="Bayesian Hyperparameter Optimization"></a>Bayesian Hyperparameter Optimization</h2><p>The one-sentence summary of Bayesian hyperparameter optimization is: build a probability model of the objective function and use it to select the most promising hyperparameters to evaluate in the true objective function.</p>
<p>The basic idea is: spend a little more time selecting the next hyperparameters in order to make fewer calls to the objective function. </p>
<p>In the case of hyperparameter optimization, the objective function is the validation error of a machine learning model using a set of hyperparameters. The aim is to find the hyperparameters that yield the lowest error on the validation set in the hope that these results generalize to the testing set. Evaluating the objective function is expensive because it requires training the machine learning model with a specific set of hyperparameters. Ideally, we want a method that can explore the search space while also limiting evaluations of poor hyperparameter choices. Bayesian hyperparameter tuning uses a continually updated probability model to “concentrate” on promising hyperparameters by reasoning from past results.</p>
<p>有很多基于这种思想的实现，hyperopt 只是其中一种<br>There are several Bayesian optimization libraries in Python which differ in the algorithm for the surrogate of the objective function. In this article, we will work with Hyperopt, which uses the Tree Parzen Estimator (TPE) Other Python libraries include Spearmint (Gaussian Process surrogate) and SMAC (Random Forest Regression). </p>
<p>There are four parts to a Bayesian Optimization problem:</p>
<ul>
<li>Objective Function: what we want to minimize, in this case the validation error of a machine learning model with respect to the hyperparameters （原来model 中的 objective function）</li>
<li>Domain Space: hyperparameter values to search over （调参空间）</li>
<li>Optimization algorithm: method for constructing the surrogate model and choosing the next hyperparameter values to evaluate （loss 和调参空间的 新的关系）</li>
<li>Result history: stored outcomes from evaluations of the objective function consisting of the hyperparameters and validation loss （result 没有什么好说的）</li>
</ul>
<p>其中的 Bayesian Hyperparameter Optimization using Hyperopt是可以好好学习的。 data scientists  这种东西更加贴近于 data scientist 真的。<br>参考一：<br><a href="https://github.com/WillKoehrsen/hyperparameter-optimization/blob/master/Bayesian%20Hyperparameter%20Optimization%20of%20Gradient%20Boosting%20Machine.ipynb" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://github.com/WillKoehrsen/hyperparameter-optimization/blob/master/Bayesian%20Hyperparameter%20Optimization%20of%20Gradient%20Boosting%20Machine.ipynb</a></p>

            <p>Natural Language Processing is used to apply machine learning algorithms to text and speech. For example, we can use it to create systems like speech recognition, document summarization, machine translation, spam detection, named entity recognition, question answering, autocomplete, predictive typingand so on.</p>
<p>NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) is a leading platform for building Python programs to work with human language data. It provides easy-to-use interfaces to many corpora and lexical resources. Also, it contains a suite of text processing libraries for classification, tokenization, stemming, tagging, parsing, and semantic reasoning. Best of all, NLTK is a free, open source, community-driven project.</p>
<p>In this article, we’ll cover the following topics.<br>这些功能都是可以使用nltk 进行实现的。<br><strong>text Lemmatization</strong> 比如，单词“cars”词形还原后的单词为“car”，单词“ate”词形还原后的单词为“eat”。</p>
<p><strong>Sentence Tokenization</strong><br>这个的级别就是 将段落 tokenization成一个个的句子。<br>Sentence tokenization (also called sentence segmentation) is the problem of dividing a string of written language into its component sentences. The idea here looks very simple. In English and some other languages, we can split apart the sentences whenever we see a punctuation mark.（标点符号）</p>
<p><strong>Word Tokenization</strong><br>这个token 相对于 sentence level ，颗粒度变得更小。<br>Word tokenization (also called word segmentation) is the problem of dividing a string of written language into its component words. In English and many other languages using some form of Latin alphabet, space is a good approximation of a word divider.</p>
<p><strong>Text Lemmatization and Stemming</strong><br>这种操作如果被认为是一种 normalization，那么一个优点就是加快了运行的速度。从不同的形式到统一的形式，这可以认为减少了变量。感觉这个更加涉及语法，语法树之类的东西。<br>For grammatical reasons, documents can contain different forms of a wordsuch as drive, drives, driving. Also, sometimes we have related words with a similar meaning, such as nation, national, nationality.</p>
<p>Stemming and lemmatization are special cases of normalization. However, they are different from each other.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Stemming usually refers to a crude heuristic process that chops off the ends of words in the hope of achieving this goal correctly most of the time, and often includes the removal of derivational affixes.<br>Lemmatization usually refers to doing things properly with the use of a vocabulary and morphological analysis of words, normally aiming to remove inflectional endings only and to return the base or dictionary form of a word, which is known as the lemma.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Stop Words</strong><br>因为 stop words往往是带了 noise rather than useful information，所以这个是要去掉的。<br>Stop words are words which are filtered out before or after processing of text. When applying machine learning to text, these words can add a lot of noise. That’s why we want to remove these irrelevant words.</p>
<p>这个是stop words dictionary 是一种过滤词表，是可以根据应用的不同，然后 change的。<br>Stop words usually refer to the most common words such as “and”, “the”, “a” in a language, but there is no single universal list of stopwords. The list of the stop words can change depending on your application.</p>
<p>在存储 stopword 的时候使用 set rather than list 主要原因是  much faster than search operations in a set.<br>You might wonder why we convert our list into a set. Set is an abstract data type that can store unique values, without any particular order. The search operation in a set is much faster than the search operation in a list. For a small number of words, there is no big difference, but if you have a large number of words it’s highly recommended to use the set type.</p>
<p><strong>Regex</strong><br>A kind of search pattern. A regular expression, regex, or regexp is a sequence of characters that define a search pattern. Let’s see some basics.</p>
<figure class="highlight python"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">. - match any character <span class="keyword">except</span> newline</span><br><span class="line">\w - match word</span><br><span class="line">\d - match digit</span><br><span class="line">\s - match whitespace</span><br><span class="line">\W - match <span class="keyword">not</span> word</span><br><span class="line">\D - match <span class="keyword">not</span> digit</span><br><span class="line">\S - match <span class="keyword">not</span> whitespace</span><br><span class="line">[abc] - match any of a, b, <span class="keyword">or</span> c</span><br><span class="line">[^abc] - <span class="keyword">not</span> match a, b, <span class="keyword">or</span> c</span><br><span class="line">[a-g] - match a character between a &amp; g</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>这个解释说明了为什么在正则表达式 中使用 r”” 作为一种前缀。因为正则表达是中 ”\“ 的使用和 python 中的”\” 使用有冲突。简而言之，如果加上了 r”” 那么这个就是一种完全的 正则表达式的语法了。</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Regular expressions use the backslash character (‘\’) to indicate special forms or to allow special characters to be used without invoking their special meaning. This collides with Python’s usage of the same character for the same purpose in string literals; for example, to match a literal backslash, one might have to write ‘\\‘ as the pattern string, because the regular expression must be \, and each backslash must be expressed as \ inside a regular Python string literal.<br>The solution is to use Python’s raw string notation for regular expression patterns; backslashes are not handled in any special way in a string literal prefixed with ‘r’. So r”\n” is a two-character string containing ‘\’ and ‘n’, while “\n” is a one-character string containing a newline. Usually, patterns will be expressed in Python code using this raw string notation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Bag of words</strong></p>
<p><img src="http://ww1.sinaimg.cn/large/e9a223b5ly1g38517f1imj20du0e4aa4.jpg" alt=""><br>Machine learning algorithms cannot work with raw text directly, we need to convert the text into vectors of numbers. This is called feature extraction.<br>The bag-of-words model is a popular and simple feature extraction technique used when we work with text. It describes the occurrence of each word within a document.</p>
<p>这个是 bag  of words的”特点“： order or structure of words 没有了。<br>Any information about the order or structure of words is discarded. That’s why it’s called a bag of words. This model is trying to understand whether a known word occurs in a document, but don’t know where is that word in the document.</p>
<p>The intuition is that similar documents have similar contents. Also, from a content, we can learn something about the meaning of the document.</p>
<p>To use this model, we need to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Design a vocabulary of known words (also called tokens)</li>
<li>Choose a measure of the presence of known words</li>
</ul>
<p>第一种 measure 方式：<br>最简单的方式是 “occurrence” ，如果出现了 标为1 否则标为0；<br>这种是最为简单的 bag of words 最的方式，这四个是一一对应的。注意体会。</p>
<p><img src="http://ww1.sinaimg.cn/large/e9a223b5ly1g38p4a4jq9j20va08it8z.jpg" alt=""><br><img src="http://ww1.sinaimg.cn/large/e9a223b5ly1g38p4hhhltj20o607uq3f.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The complexity of the bag-of-words model comes in deciding how to design the vocabulary of known words (tokens) and how to score the presence of known words.</p>
<p>In some cases, we can have a huge amount of data and in this cases, the length of the vector that represents a document might be thousands or millions of elements. Furthermore, each document may contain only a few of the known words in the vocabulary.<br>Therefore the vector representations will have a lot of zeros. These vectors which have a lot of zeros are called sparse vectors. They require more memory and computational resources.<br>We can decrease the number of the known words when using a bag-of-words model to decrease the required memory and computational resources. We can use the text cleaning techniques we’ve already seen in this article before we create our bag-of-words model:</p>
<p>减少 dictionary size 的方式。</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ignoring punctuation<br>Removing the stop words from our documents<br>Reducing the words to their base form (Text Lemmatization and Stemming)<br>Fixing misspelled words</p>
</blockquote>
<p>n-gram 的思想是很广泛：通过 sequence of words，这个是可以增加文本的表达力的。<br>An n-gram is a sequence of a number of items (words, letter, numbers, digits, etc.). In the context of text corpora, n-grams typically refer to a sequence of words. A unigram is one word, a bigram is a sequence of two words, a trigram is a sequence of three words etc.</p>
<p>关于如何去 score the presence  of word： 这里是有三种方式的。<br>We saw one very simple approach - the binary approach (1 for presence, 0 for absence).<br>Some additional scoring methods are:<br>Counts. Count the number of times each word appears in a document.<br>Frequencies. Calculate the frequency that each word appears in document out of all the words in the document.</p>
<p>TF-IDF 这个语境 是相对于 frequency 而言的，关键词是不一定有 频率所决定，而一些 rarer or domain-specific words 可能是更加常见的。<br>One problem with scoring word frequency is that the most frequent words in the document start to have the highest scores. These frequent words may not contain as much “informational gain” to the model compared with some rarer and domain-specific words. One approach to fix that problem is to penalize words that are frequent across all the documents. This approach is called TF-IDF.</p>
<p>TF-IDF, short for term frequency-inverse document frequency is a statistical measure used to evaluate the importance of a word to a document in a collection or corpus.</p>

            <p>题目都是来自牛客网在线刷题中的剑指offer。最近找实习工作，作为刷题记录，顺便从考察知识点的角度分类整理。主要分成以下四大类：</p>
<ul>
<li>字符串、数组</li>
<li>链表、树</li>
<li>递归、回溯、动态规划</li>
<li>其他, 比如位运算、正则匹配等 </li>
</ul>
<p>不同类别以一章介绍，之后可能会随时update。这是剑指offer 系列四部曲中的第一部：。第一部关于字符串和数组，第二部是<a href="https://jijeng.github.io/2019/05/17/%E5%89%91%E6%8C%87Offer-%E6%A0%88-%E9%98%9F%E5%88%97-%E9%93%BE%E8%A1%A8%E5%92%8C%E6%A0%91/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">栈、队列、链表和树</a>，第三部<a href="https://jijeng.github.io/2019/05/17/%E5%89%91%E6%8C%87offer-%E9%80%92%E5%BD%92-%E5%9B%9E%E6%BA%AF%E5%92%8C%E5%8A%A8%E6%80%81%E8%A7%84%E5%88%92/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">递归、回溯和动态规划</a>， 最后一部分在<a href="https://jijeng.github.io/2019/05/17/%E5%89%91%E6%8C%87offer-%E5%85%B6%E4%BB%96/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">这里</a>。</p>
<ul>
<li>二维数组中的查找</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>在一个二维数组中（每个一维数组的长度相同），每一行都按照从左到右递增的顺序排序，每一列都按照从上到下递增的顺序排序。请完成一个函数，输入这样的一个二维数组和一个整数，判断数组中是否含有该整数。</p>

<p>HZ偶尔会拿些专业问题来忽悠那些非计算机专业的同学。今天测试组开完会后,他又发话了:在古老的一维模式识别中,常常需要计算连续子向量的最大和,当向量全为正数的时候,问题很好解决。但是,如果向量中包含负数,是否应该包含某个负数,并期望旁边的正数会弥补它呢？例如:{6,-3,-2,7,-15,1,2,2},连续子向量的最大和为8(从第0个开始,到第3个为止)。给一个数组，返回它的最大连续子序列的和，你会不会被他忽悠住？(子向量的长度至少是1)</p>

<p>LL今天心情特别好,因为他去买了一副扑克牌,发现里面居然有2个大王,2个小王(一副牌原本是54张^_^)…他随机从中抽出了5张牌,想测测自己的手气,看看能不能抽到顺子,如果抽到的话,他决定去买体育彩票,嘿嘿！！“红心A,黑桃3,小王,大王,方片5”,“Oh My God!”不是顺子…..LL不高兴了,他想了想,决定大\小 王可以看成任何数字,并且A看作1,J为11,Q为12,K为13。上面的5张牌就可以变成“1,2,3,4,5”(大小王分别看作2和4),“So Lucky!”。LL决定去买体育彩票啦。 现在,要求你使用这幅牌模拟上面的过程,然后告诉我们LL的运气如何， 如果牌能组成顺子就输出true，否则就输出false。为了方便起见,你可以认为大小王是0。</p>

<p>每年六一儿童节,牛客都会准备一些小礼物去看望孤儿院的小朋友,今年亦是如此。HF作为牛客的资深元老,自然也准备了一些小游戏。其中,有个游戏是这样的:首先,让小朋友们围成一个大圈。然后,他随机指定一个数m,让编号为0的小朋友开始报数。每次喊到m-1的那个小朋友要出列唱首歌,然后可以在礼品箱中任意的挑选礼物,并且不再回到圈中,从他的下一个小朋友开始,继续0…m-1报数….这样下去….直到剩下最后一个小朋友,可以不用表演,并且拿到牛客名贵的“名侦探柯南”典藏版(名额有限哦!!^_^)。请你试着想下,哪个小朋友会得到这份礼品呢？(注：小朋友的编号是从0到n-1)</p>

            <p><strong>pygen功能：</strong>有关联的随机生成人名，邮箱，ID Card (ssn)，电话，地址等信息，并且可以选择保存为 pandas dataframe格式, 数据库”.db” 文件, Excel 文件和csv 文件格式，用于机器学习训练。<a href="https://github.com/jijeng/pygen" target="_blank" rel="noopener">项目地址github</a>。</p>
<p>随机生成虚假个人信息具有很大的应用空间。首先，虚假的生成数据可以用于机器学习模型的“准备数据”，当真实的数据比较少或者难以获得的时候，可以使用生成数据进行训练模型，待模型调通之后，然后使用真实的模型。并且，当真实的数据集中缺少某些特征时候，可以使用这种方法进行特征的填充。比如大的数据集中缺少现居城市地址的时候，可以调用该库中的 “city_real” 进行填充。</p>
<p>当前使用最为广泛的是 <a href="https://faker.readthedocs.io/en/master/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Faker</a> 开源库用于数据的生成。虽然该库支持中文，但是对于中文的支持力度有限，所以有时候并不能满足我的需求，比如说生成的身份证 (ssn) 和姓名所能体现的性别是不匹配(了解更多可以参考<a href="https://github.com/jayknoxqu/id-number-util" target="_blank" rel="noopener">这里</a>)、生成的姓名中缺少复姓和电话邮箱等信息不符合我们的使用习惯等等。所以我将从以下几点改进：</p>
<ul>
<li>增强数据之间相关性</li>
<li>生成名字的多样性</li>
<li>符合国人使用习惯的邮箱电话</li>
<li>提供保存多种保存文件格式，更加适合机器学习的训练</li>
</ul>
<p>中文名字有很强的性别属性。例如名字中带有“杰”“志”“宏”等字的一般为男性，带有“琬”“佩”“梅”等字的一般为女性。当然也有一些比较中性的字，例如“文”“安”“清”等，比较难猜测性别，关于这点会在另一个博客中展开，请期待。<br>在faker 中生成的结果如下图：</p>
<pre><code>from faker import Faker
fake = Faker(&apos;zh_CN&apos;)
for _ in range(10):
    print(fake.name(),fake.ssn(),fake.phone_number())
</code></pre><p><img src="http://ww1.sinaimg.cn/large/e9a223b5ly1g2dgyq294dj20kg09sq39.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>从图中可以明显的看出 “王玉梅”和 “李桂花”都是两个女性，但是这种身份证信息（ssn）都没有体现这点。关于身份证的科普信息可以从这里获得。简单来说倒数第二位表示性别信息，如果是男性就是奇数如果是女性就是偶数。faker 生成的数据是不具有数据之间的相关性的。</p>
<p>基于此，我们进行了改进。首先是姓名的生成，然后是性别的判断，最后再生成相应性别的身份证号码。</p>
<pre><code>from pygen import pygen
db =pygen()
db.gen_dataframe(fields =[&apos;name&apos;, &apos;ssn&apos;, &apos;phone&apos;, &apos;email&apos;])
</code></pre><p>效果如下：<br><img src="http://ww1.sinaimg.cn/large/e9a223b5ly1g2dhis3u0qj20vm0iq75a.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="http://ww1.sinaimg.cn/large/e9a223b5ly1g2dhj273lrj20vc0iwjsf.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>红色线条表示姓名和性别对应一致，蓝色线条表示结果不确定（“镜阳炎” 像是一个中性的名字），绿色表示生成了含有复姓的名字，增强了数据的多样性。</p>
<p>从上图的 “mail” 一列可以看出邮箱前缀的命名基本上是中文名字中“姓” 和“民”的拼音组合，加强了数据之间的相关性和真实度。</p>
<p>另外，电话号码按照运营商分为三类：0 表示移动，1表示联通，2表示电信。</p>
<pre><code>print(&apos;移动字段:&apos;)
for _ in range(5):
  print(db.simple_ph_num(types =0))

print(&apos;联通字段:&apos;)
for _ in range(5):
  print(db.simple_ph_num(types =1))

print(&apos;电信字段：&apos;)
for _ in range(5):
  print(db.simple_ph_num(types =2))
</code></pre><p>输出：</p>
<blockquote>
<p>移动字段: 15023689929 16771753917 16790223946 15950129353 15271129554<br>联通字段: 13869739303 13786227031 13950354445 15137578545 15240836142<br>电信字段： 17172983067 15658567011 18562313243 17073127396 15543448286</p>
</blockquote>
<p>最后提供了多种文件保存格式，包括”.csv”, “.db” 和”.xlsx”等格式。可以使用如下：</p>
<pre><code>from pygen import pygen
db =pygen()
db.gen_table(filename =filename, fields =[&apos;name&apos;, &apos;ssn&apos;, &apos;phone&apos;, &apos;email&apos;])
db.gen_excel(filename =filename, fields =[&apos;name&apos;, &apos;ssn&apos;, &apos;phone&apos;, &apos;email&apos;])
db.gen_csv(filename =filename, fields =[&apos;name&apos;, &apos;ssn&apos;, &apos;phone&apos;, &apos;email&apos;])
</code></pre>

            <p>Mode collapse, a failure case for GANs where the generator generate a limited diversity of samples, regardless of the input.</p>
<p>But what causes the mode collapse? There are four reasons for that.</p>
<p><strong>The objective of GANs</strong></p>
<p>The generator, generates new data, while the discriminator evaluates it for authenticity but not for the diversity of generated instances.</p>
<p>the generator can win by producing a polynomial number of training examples. And a low capacity discriminator cannot detect this process, thus, it cannot guide the generator to approximate the target distribution. Even if a high discriminator identifies and assigns the collapse part a low probability, then the generator will simply move from its collapsed output to focus on another fixed output point.</p>
<p><strong>Generator</strong></p>
<p>No matter the objective function is, if it only considers individual samples (without looking forward or backward) then the generator is not directly incentivised to produce diverse examples.</p>
<p>From [1], standard GAN training corresponds exactly to updating the generator parameters using only the first term in this gradient because of a fixed discriminator during GAN training. Therefore, in standard GAN training, each generator updata step is a partial collapse towards a delta function.</p>
<p>$$<br>\frac { \mathrm { d } f _ { K } \left( \theta _ { G } , \theta _ { D } \right) } { \mathrm { d } \theta _ { G } } = \frac { \partial f \left( \theta _ { G } , \theta _ { D } ^ { K } \left( \theta _ { G } , \theta _ { D } \right) \right) } { \partial \theta _ { G } } + \frac { \partial f \left( \theta _ { G } , \theta _ { D } ^ { K } \left( \theta _ { G } , \theta _ { D } \right) \right) } { \partial \theta _ { D } ^ { K } \left( \theta _ { G } , \theta _ { D } \right) } \frac { \mathrm { d } \theta _ { D } ^ { K } \left( \theta _ { G } , \theta _ { D } \right) } { \mathrm { d } \theta _ { G } }<br>$$</p>
<p>Some methods have been proposed. Multiple generators and weight-sharing generators are developed to capture more modes of the distribution. </p>
<p><strong>Discriminator</strong></p>
<p>The mode collapse is often explained as gradient exploding of discriminator, which comes from the imbalance between the discriminator and the generator. For example, the technique of TTUR could help discriminator to keep its optimality. But some researchers believe that this is a desirable goal since a good discriminator can give good feedback and ignore the fact.</p>
<p>In addition, the discriminator process each example independently, the generator depends on generator, thus  no mechanism to tell the outputs of the generator to become more similar to each other. </p>
<p>The idea from [2], that we could use minibatch discrimination to help generator give better feedback</p>
<p>A straightforward approach to handle multimodality is to take random noise vectors along with the conditional contexts as inputs, where the contexts determine the main content and noise vectors are responsible for variations.<br>The noise vectors are ignored or of minor impacts, since cGANs pay more attention to learn from the highdimensional and structured conditional contexts. </p>
<p><strong>Another question</strong></p>
<p>Mode collapse may happen only partially?<br>since training is stochastic progress, the input of generator network will vary and the sample drawn from the real distribution will also vary</p>
<p>But sometimes mode collapse is not all bad news. In style transfer using GAN, we are happy to convert one image to just a good one, rather than finding all variants. Indeed, the specialization in the partial mode collapse sometimes creates higher quality images.</p>

            <p>Setting the hyper-parameters seems like a black art that requires years of experience to acquire. Currently, there are no simple and easy ways to set hyper-parameters- specifically, batch size, learning rate, momentum, and weight decay. A grid search or random search maybe sounds like a good idea. In this blog, I’d like to share you my idea from reading papers and my projects.</p>
<h2 id="Hyper-parameters"><a href="#Hyper-parameters" class="headerlink" title="Hyper-parameters"></a>Hyper-parameters</h2><h3 id="Batch-Size"><a href="#Batch-Size" class="headerlink" title="Batch Size"></a>Batch Size</h3><p>Learning rate is maybe the most important hyper-parameters, but we choose batch size firstly because large batch size needs a large learning rate in most circumstances.</p>
<p>A general principle is: use as a large batch size as possible to fit your CPU memory or/both GPU memory. There are several reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>larger batch sizes permit the use of larger learning rates</li>
<li>A constant number of iterations favors larger batch sizes</li>
</ul>
<p>However, small batch sizes add regularization while large batch sizes add less. So utilize it while balancing the proper amount of regularization.</p>
<h3 id="Learning-Rate"><a href="#Learning-Rate" class="headerlink" title="Learning Rate"></a>Learning Rate</h3><p>We will introduce the idea from [Cyclical Learning Rates for Training Neural Networks][1]: Cyclical Learning Rates.</p>
<p>Instead of monotonically decreasing the learning rate, this method lets the learning rate cyclically vary between reasonable boundary values. The essence of this learning rate policy comes from the observation that increasing the learning rate might have a short term negative effect and yet achieve a longer term beneficial effect. This observation leads to the idea of letting the learning rate vary within a range of values rather than adopting a stepwise fixed or exponentially decreasing value. That is, one sets minimum and maximum boundaries and the learning rate cyclically varies between these bounds.<br><img src="http://ww1.sinaimg.cn/large/e9a223b5ly1g25wjj6cu9j20p80gcwh4.jpg" alt=""><br><small>From Cyclical Learning Rates for Training Neural Networks </small></p>
<p>An intuitive understanding of why CLR methods work comes from considering the loss function topology. Dauphin et al. argue that the difficulty in minimizing the loss arises from saddle points rather than poor local minima. Saddle points have small gradients that slow the learning process. However, increasing the learning rate allows for more rapid traversal of saddle point plateaus.</p>
<p>But the question is that how can we find the Minimum bound and Maximum bound. There is a simple way to estimate the reasonable minimum and maximum boundary values with one training run of the network for a few epochs. It is a “LR range test”; run your model for several epochs while letting the learning rate increase linearly between low and high LR values. For example, set both the step size and max iter to the same number of iterations. In this case, the learning rate will increase linearly from the minimum value to the maximum value during this short run. Next, plot the accuracy versus learning rate. Note the learning rate value when the accuracy starts to increase and when the accuracy slows, becomes ragged, or starts to fall. These two learning rates are good choices for bounds; that is, set base-lr to the first value and set max-lr to the latter value.</p>
<h3 id="Momentum"><a href="#Momentum" class="headerlink" title="Momentum"></a>Momentum</h3><p>Since learning rate is regarded as the most important hyper-parameter to tune then momentum is also important. Like learning rates, it is valuable to set momentum as large as possible without causing instabilities during training.</p>
<p>The large learning rate can deal with local minimum but works fail when it comes to saddle point where momentum comes to rescue.</p>
<p>The local minimum is like the following picture.<br><img src="http://ww1.sinaimg.cn/large/e9a223b5ly1g25x29cb1dj20y00iogs2.jpg" alt=""><br>In mathematics, a saddle point or minimax point is a point on the surface of the graph of a function <strong>where the slopes (derivatives) in orthogonal directions are all zero</strong> (a critical point), but which is not a local extremum of the function.</p>
<p>Your first step from the very top would likely take you down, but then you’d be on a flat rice terrace. The gradient would be zero, and you’d have nowhere to go. To remedy this, we employ momentum - the algorithm remembers its last step and adds some psroportion of it to the current step. This way, even if the algorithm is stuck in a flat region, or a small local minimum, it can get out and continue towards the true minimum.</p>
<p>In summary: when performing gradient descent, learning rate measures how much the current situation affects the next step, while momentum measures how much past steps affect the next step.</p>
<h3 id="Weights-Decay"><a href="#Weights-Decay" class="headerlink" title="Weights Decay"></a>Weights Decay</h3><p>When training neural networks, it is common to use “weight decay,” where after each update, the weights are multiplied by a factor slightly less than 1. This prevents the weights from growing too large and can be seen as gradient descent on a quadratic regularization term.</p>
<p>But why?</p>
<p>Large weights might correlate with certain patterns in the input data (x), this means that the model almost hard codes certain values. This then makes our training data fit well but our test data fit less well.</p>
<p>The idea of weight decay is simple: to prevent overfitting, every time we update a weight $w$ with the gradient $∇J$ in respect to $w$, we also subtract from it $λ∙w$. This gives the weights a tendency to decay towards zero, hence the name. L2 is a type of weights decay.<br>$$<br>J ( W ; X , y ) + \frac { 1 } { 2 } \lambda \cdot | W | ^ { 2 }<br>$$</p>
<p>But weights decay is not necessarily true for all gradient-base algorithms and was recently shown to not be the case for adaptive gradient algorithms, such as Adam.</p>
<p>In addition, weight decay is not the only regularization technique. In the past few years, some other approaches have been introduced such as Dropout, Bagging, Early Stop, and Parameter Sharing which work very well in NNs.</p>
